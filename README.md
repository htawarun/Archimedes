Archimedes Rules Repository
==========================

Archimedes is an open source tool to extract and store metadata model components.  It uses a series of transformation
objects to create, persist, and transform from a source repository to a target repository.

The original project was used by clients to create rules reports (HTML) for online documentation.

The latest changes have introduced a new model including model versions and persistence using REST services
instead of SQL.
