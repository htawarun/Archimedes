		<h1>Repository Analysis</h1>
		This is the top-level information about the repository :

		<a name="topLevelNode"></a>
		<h3>Top level node</h3>
		This is the root node for the analysis tree. It displays the name of the
		repository, and the root directory for the repository.

		<a name="topLevelTotalCode"></a>
		<h3>Total amount of code</h3>
		The total amount of Java code in the entire repository. This only includes
		actual Java code, i.e. blank lines, comments, etc... are ignored.

		<a name="topLevelTotalGeneratedCode"></a>
		<h3>Total amount of generated code</h3>
		The total amount of Java code in the entire repository that was generated by Versata.
		This is found by looking for special markers that start with //{{

		<a name="topLevelTotalUserCode"></a>
		<h3>Total amount of user code</h3>
		The total amount of Java code in the entire repository that was not generated by Versata.
		Note that this number is not 100% exact, but it should be very close. The typical error
		margin is 1-3 lines of code per file that can be confused for user-written code.
