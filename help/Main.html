		<h1>Archimedes Metadata Rules Analyzer</h1>
		The Archimedes Metadata Rules Analyzer is a tool designed to gather statistics about
		a Versata repository. The intent is to help you understand better the complexity
		of your repository, and in particular how much code you are writing, compared to
		how much code is being generated by Versata.
		<p>
		To get help on any item in the analysis tree, select that item and hit F1.

		<h2>Opening a repository</h2>
		You can open a repository in two ways :
		<h3>Command line</h3>
		When starting Archimedes, you can specify the repository to be opened as one
		or	two	arguments.<br>
		You can specify the path to the XML file for the repository, e.g. <code>c:\foo\myrepo\Source\myrepo.xml</code><br>
		You can also specify the repository's root directory as the first argument, and the name of the
		repository file as the second argument, e.g. <code>c:\foo\myrepo myrepo.xml</code><br>
		Note that the second way (with two arguments) is there so that Archimedes
		can be fired as an external tool	in the Versata Studio.
		<h3>Setting up Archimedes as an external tool</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>open the Versata Studio
			<li>select Tools -> External Tools...
			<li>click Add...
			<li>under Menu Line, enter "Archimedes Metadata Rules Analyzer"
			<li>under Command, enter the fully qualified name of the AutomationAnalyzer.bat
			  file, e.g. <code>c:\Versata\Archimedes\archimedes.bat</code> (you
			  can click the ... button and browse for that file)
			<li>under Parameters, enter : <code>curRepoPath curRepoFileName</code>
			<li>click OK
			<li>click Close
		</ul>
		<h3>Menu</h3>
		The other way to open a repository is to simply start the AA without any command-line arguments,
		and then selecting the File->Open menu. This will open a file browsing dialog, which you can use to
		select the repository's XML file (located in the Source subdirectory of the repository's root
		directory).

		<h2>Saving a report</h2>
		<p>Once you have opened a repository, and the statistics have been extracted from it,
		you can save this information as an HTML file. Note that this HTML file can be viewed
		either in a Web browser (Internet Explorer is recommended), or using Microsoft Excel.
		  <br>
		The HTML file that is generated contains some special instructions (which are invisible
		in a Web browser) that make this file easily readable by Excel. If you would like to
		change the format of the report, or print it nicely, I recommend you open it using Excel.
</p>
		<p><strong>
		<h2>Persist Repository (Save Metadata to VLS)</h2></strong>
		<p>You can persist this repository run to the Versata Logic server (VLS). Make
		  sure you first open and deploy the MetaRepos application to the VLS
		  and deploy to an SQL DBMS. You will be prompted for a version number,
		  if you leave it blank, it will default to &quot;1&quot;. This may take several
		  minutes to run (every object, attribute, method, rule, etc. will be
		  written to the VLS and persisted to the DBMS).</p>
