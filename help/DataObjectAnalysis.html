		<h1>Data Objects Analysis</h1>
		This subtree contains information about all the data objects in the repository.

		<a name="dataobject_numDataObjects"></a>
		<h3>Number of data objects</h3>
		This is the total number of data objects present in the repository.

		<a name="dataobject_totalNumAttribs"></a>
		<h3>Total number of attributes</h3>
		This is the total number of attributes across all data objects (but not
		query objects) in the repository.

		<a name="dataobject_attribs_largestNumAttribs"></a>
		<h3>Largest number of attributes</h3>
		This points out which data object has the largest number of attributes -- the name
		in parentheses is the name of the data object which has that many attributes.
		This is intended to point out any data object that might be abnormally large.

		<a name="dataobject_attribs_totalNumPersAttribs"></a>
		<h3>Total number of persistent attributes</h3>
		The total number of data object attributes in the repository that are actually
		persisted in the database, as opposed to calculated on the fly.

		<a name="dataobject_attribs_totalNumNonPersAttribs"></a>
		<h3>Total number of non-persistent attributes</h3>
		The number of data object attributes in the repository that are not persisted in the
		database, but instead are calculated on the fly when needed.<br>
		Non-persistent attributes can be parent replicates, formulas, sum or counts.

		<a name="dataobject_attribs_totalNumPreventUserUpdateAttribs"></a>
		<h3>Total number of prevent user update attributes</h3>
		The number of data object attributes in the repository that are marked as
		&quot;Prevent user update&quot;. This means that these attributes cannot
		be updated by the GUI. This is commonly used for derived attributes.

		<a name="dataobject_attribs_totalNumCVLAttribs"></a>
		<h3>Total number of coded value list attributes</h3>
		The number of data object attributes in the repository that must take their
		value from a list of acceptable values (called a Coded Value List) that is
		stored in another table. This is commonly used for enumerated types of
		attributes.<br>
		These attributes are often exposed as drop-down combo boxes, or radio buttons.

		<a name="dataobject_attribs_totalNumValidationAttribs"></a>
		<h3>Total number of validation attributes</h3>
		The number of data object attributes in the repository that have a validation
		rule attached. This rule is automatically fired whenever the value of the
		attribute changes, so that it can validate the new value -- if it rejects it,
		the change will not be applied.

		<a name="dataobject_attribs_totalNumDerivedAttribs"></a>
		<h3>Total number of derived attributes</h3>
		The number of data object attributes in the repository that are derived. This
		includes all parent replicates, sums, counts and formulas, regardless of whether
		they are persistent on not.

		of one attribute for all the object's children.

		<a name="dataobject_rules_totalNumCount"></a>
		<h3>Total number of count attributes</h3>
		The total number of count attributes across all data objects in the repository.
